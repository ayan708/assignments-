// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object that’s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

interface Car {
    manufacturer: string;
    modelName: string;
    [key: string]: any; // Allow any additional properties
}

function car_data(manufacturer: string, modelName: string,options:Partial<Car>): Car {
    return {
        manufacturer: manufacturer,
        modelName: modelName,
        ...options
    };
}

// Call the function with required information and additional name-value pairs
const car = car_data('Toyota', 'Corolla', { color: 'blue', year: 2022 });

// Print the returned object
console.log(car);
