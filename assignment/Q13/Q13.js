// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”
// Array (Favourite mode of transportation)
var favourite_mode = ['Motorcycle', 'car', 'bus', 'train', 'bycycle'];
// StateMents 
favourite_mode.forEach(function (item) {
    console.log('I would like to have', item);
});
